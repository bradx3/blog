title: "My Backup Script"

<p>
  This is my simple backup script. It keeps everything I don't already have backed up 
  in version control safe and sound from hardware failure. Not from me though - 
  if I delete a file accidentally, that file is really gone
  (unless you act fast before the next backup runs!). 
  If I make a bad edit, that file is busted.
  <br />
  <br />
  But I can live with that.

  <h3>backup.rb</h3>
  Backup.rb uses rsync over ssh to backup a number of different server. Rsync is good
  because it only sends what changed, so we're not transferring gigs every night.

  You'll have to make some changes to the SSH_USER, REMOTE_DIR and HOSTS constants. 
  You could also add any file types you want to ignore to the EXCLUDES list.

  <pre class="brush: ruby">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

NAME = %x{ hostname }.strip
SSH_USER = "brad"
REMOTE_DIR = "/home/brad/Backups/#{ NAME }"

HOSTS = [ "clamps", "hubert.lucky-dip.net" ]
DIRS = [
        "~/Library", 
        "~/Documents",
        "~/Pictures"
]
EXCLUDES = [
            "*Cache*",
            "*NewsFire*",
            "*Cookies*",
            "*.log",
            "HistoryIndex.ox*",
            "*Virtual Machines*",
            "*.resume",
            "*.ipsw",
            "*.dmg",
            "*.corrupt"
]

HOSTS.each do |host|
  DIRS.each do |dir|
    puts "
