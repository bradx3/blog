<p>
For some reason, this command:
<pre class="brush: bash">
jruby -S gem install mongrel activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter rails
</pre>
didn't install all the required gems I needed.
</p>

Manually listing all the basic rails gems needed fixed the problem for me though. Working command:
<pre class="brush: bash">
jruby -S gem install mongrel activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter rails \
activesupport actionmailer activerecord actionpack activeresource
</pre>
