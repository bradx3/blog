<p><strong>These editors have been merged into the <a href="http://aptana.com/">Aptana</a> project. Please don't post any error reports here.</strong></p> 
<p>Last release didn't go so well. For some reason I figured other people had tried to install Aptana, had it fail and then given up on it like me. Turns out I was alone haha.</p>

<p>
So I spent a bit of time figuring out what changed in RDT and fixed things up. I've tested this with a straight out of the box install of Aptana m8, so hopefully it'll work for others too.</p>

<p>
If anybody does try it, please let me know if it works or not. I'm going to use this blog post as a bit of a test before I post to the Haml mail list. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies!</p>

(Oh yeah, the update site is still http://haml.lucky-dip.net/).
