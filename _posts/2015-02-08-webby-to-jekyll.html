title: "Convert Webby to Jekyll"
---

<p>
  I'm going to blog more. When I think of the countless times other people sharing information
  helps me every day, I feel bad I don't share more.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that has been acting as a block to more sharing was my old
  blog software. It was using <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/webby">Webby</a>.
  Webby is a nice static site generator, but one that hasn't been touched
  since 2009. Every time I wanted to post, I had to reinstall Ruby 1.8.7,
  patch together the old gems and hope everything still somehow held together.
</p>
<p>
  That's too high a bar for me - most of the stuff I want to share isn't
  really enough to warrant that effort. It's not that I want to share total
  rubbish (I hope!), just that taking 45 minutes before I can even start a post
  really puts the pressure on.
</p>
<p>
  So I'm finally switching to Github pages and Jekyll. With that combination
  I can write up some HTML, commit, then push. Hopefully that's convenient enough that
  I can push up scripts, hacks, random thoughts and ideas that might help others.
</p>
<p>
  A decent way to start seems to be to post the script I used to convert
  my old posts from Webby to Jekyll. Not fancy, but it'll do the trick.

  {% highlight ruby %}
require "yaml"

root = "[local path to old blog]"
posts = "[local path to new blog]/_posts"

Dir.glob("#{root}**/*.txt").each do |f|
  next if File.basename(f) == "index.txt"

  _junk, header, body = File.read(f).split("---")

  name = File.basename(f)
  date = f.gsub(root, "").gsub("/#{name}", "").gsub("/", "-")
  metadata = YAML.load(header)
  destination = "#{posts}/#{date}-#{name.gsub('.txt', '.html')}"

  File.open(destination, "w") do |out|
    out.puts("---")
    out.puts("layout: post")
    out.puts("title: \"#{metadata['title']}\"")
    out.puts("date: #{metadata['created_at']}")
    out.puts("---")
    out.puts(body.gsub("\r\n", "\n"))
  end

  puts(f)
  puts(destination)
  puts("==============================")
end
  {% endhighlight %}
</p>
