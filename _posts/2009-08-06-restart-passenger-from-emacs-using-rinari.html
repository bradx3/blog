Being able to completely re-program your editor is fun. I feel like I've got a 
long way to go before I'm an Emacs Guru (if anybody *ever* becomes a true
Emacs Guru), but it's nice being able to easily
automate things I do in my editor.

I've been experimenting with using <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>
in development instead of script/server. It's not too bad. It's nice to have
a server always ready to go, but it does make dropping down to the debugger
difficult.

<p>
Anyway, here is a small snippet of emacs lisp to easily restart the Passenger
server for the project you are currently working on. It assumes you have 
<a href="http://rinari.rubyforge.org/">Rinari</a> installed.

<h4>The function:</h4>
<pre class="brush: plain">
(defun restart-passenger ()
  "Restart passenger using the current rinari root" (interactive)
  (shell-command (concat "touch " (rinari-root) "tmp/restart.txt")))
</pre>
<h4>And to bind it to a key</h4>
<pre class="brush: plain">
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c ' p") 'restart-passenger)
</pre>
</p>
