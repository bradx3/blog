  The server this blog runs on hosts a few things for - email, a few sites and some git repositories. It's got 512mb or ram, but rubygems and even git can get pretty greedy at times. I finally had enough.
</p>
<p>
  Typo and mysql were only being used for the blog and were taking up a heap or ram. I looked around and <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/">Webby</a> seemed a good fit. 
</p>
<p>
  I've managed to convert the old articles and comments to Webby and Disqus format. There's currently some problems with the comments not displaying, so I'll have to fix that, but I can live with that for now.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway if anybody notices any problems, please leave a comment and I'll get it fixed up. Unless it's a problem posting comments.

  <strong>
    Update: Comments are display fine now. Wooh.
  </strong>
