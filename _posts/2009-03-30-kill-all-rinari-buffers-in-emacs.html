title: "Kill All Rinari Buffers in Emacs"

<p>
I've been using Emacs for development for a few months now and am pretty happy with it. 
</p>
<p>
I use the Rinari mode to provide some help when I'm working on Rails projects. Once I'm finished for the day (or changing
to another project, I used to use the kill-some-buffers command and go through them one by one.
</p>
<p>
Here's some elisp that I've written and put in my .emacs file that just kills all buffers that link to files
that are in the current rinari-root. It's probably not perfect, but it seems to work most of the time.
</p>
<pre class="brush: plain">
;; some rinari helpers
(defun kill-buffers-in-subdir (subdir buffer)
  "Kills the given buffer if it is linked to a file in the current rinari project."
  (if (buffer-in-subdir-p subdir buffer)
     (kill-buffer buffer)))

(defun buffer-in-subdir-p (subdir buffer) 
  "Returns true if buffer belongs to the current rinari project"
  (and (buffer-file-name buffer)
       (string-match subdir (buffer-file-name buffer))))

(defun kill-all-rinari-buffers ()
  "Kills all buffers linked to the current rinari project"
  (interactive)
  (let ((path (rinari-root)))
    (if path
	(dolist (buffer (buffer-list))
	  (kill-buffers-in-subdir path buffer)))))
</pre>
