<h3>The $20 a month more for beer dream</h3>
<p>
  I've been hosting this blog on Slicehost for a while now. They have been a
  good host, but a full slice is more than I need these days.
</p>

<h3>The plan</h3>
<p>
  After a bit of thinking, I realised I could pretty easily move this blog
  across to Heroku. It's just a bunch of static files created by 
  <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/">Webby</a>, so I figured a tiny
  <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> app would be just the trick.
</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>
  Sinatra is perfect for these kind of tiny jobs, and ended up working without
  too much effort. I had a bit of a wrestle with Heroku initially. 
  I couldn't seem to get heroku to read my articles. They were stored in a
  directory called "output". 
</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>
  After a while, I tried tried renaming the directory to "public". That 
  seemed to do the trick. Heroku mentions that you can <i>read</i> the filesystem
  but I couldn't find too much mention of exactly <i>what</i> you can read.
  A directory called "public" seems like a pretty safe bet to be readable forever 
  though.
  I told Webby to start buiding to the public directory instead. Here's my 
  SiteFile:
  <pre>SITE.blog_dir = "articles"
SITE.output_dir = "public"</pre>
</p>
  
<h3>The app</h3>
<p>
  After getting that working, the script worked on Heroku. It's just as 
  simple as I'd hoped it would be. 
  <pre class="brush: ruby">require "rubygems"
require "sinatra"

DIR = 'public'
set :public, DIR

get '/' do
  read('index.html')
end

get '/articles/*' do
  read('articles', params["splat"], 'index.html')
end

def read(*parts)
  File.read(File.join([ DIR ] + parts))
end</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Not much to it - read index.html for the root path, or read the article 
  page for any article. It'd probably be possible to merge these into a single
  route, but it seems like that would just complicate things unecessarily.
