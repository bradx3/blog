title: Quieter Errors with Sidekiq
---

<p>
  At my current job, we do a lot of integration with external APIs. In
  order to keep our UI snappy and our web servers happy, we send a lot of
  that communication into <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> workers.
</p>

<p>
  That mostly works well, but we do hit temporary problems sometimes (network
  timeouts, random failures on the other end, etc). Sidekiq really tries hard
  to let you fix errors in workers, <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Error-Handling">trying 25 times</a>
  before conceding defeat, so often these temporary failures are best handled
  by letting Sidekiq do it's thing.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately when combined with an error notification service like
  <a href="https://rollbar.com">Rollbar</a> (or <a href="https://airbrake.io/">Airbrake</a> or
  <a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a>) you can end up with some
  really noisy errors. Below is a small snippet that will only send through
  the first error to Rollbar.
</p>

<p>
  I'd prefer to be able to make every line of our app handle every possible
  error that can come up. We're working on that. Until that happens, having
  a single error per worker means we don't end up prioritising worker errors
  over web server errors becuase they look 25 times more common!
</p>

<p>
  {% highlight ruby %}
  # Some Sidekiq middleware to stop us sending errors for every single
  # retry to rollbar
  class SilenceRetryErrorMiddleware
    def call(_worker_class, msg, _queue)
      if msg.key?("retry_count")
        Rollbar.silenced { yield }
      else
        yield
      end
    end
  end

  Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
    config.server_middleware do |chain|
      chain.add(SilenceRetryErrorMiddleware)
    end
  end
  {% endhighlight %}
