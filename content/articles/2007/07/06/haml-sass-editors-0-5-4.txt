<div class="article"><h1><%= link_to_page(@page) %><span class="date">(<%= @page.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') %>)</span></h1><div class="body"><p>Last release didn't go so well. For some reason I figured other people had tried to install Aptana, had it fail and then given up on it like me. Turns out I was alone haha.</p>

<p>
So I spent a bit of time figuring out what changed in RDT and fixed things up. I've tested this with a straight out of the box install of Aptana m8, so hopefully it'll work for others too.</p>

<p>
If anybody does try it, please let me know if it works or not. I'm going to use this blog post as a bit of a test before I post to the Haml mail list. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies!</p>
