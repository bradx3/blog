<p>
For some reason, this command:
<% coderay(:lang => "bash", :line_numbers => :list) do -%>
jruby -S gem install mongrel activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter rails
<% end -%>
didn't install all the required gems I needed.

Manually listing all the basic rails gems needed fixed the problem for me though. Working command:
<% coderay(:lang => "bash", :line_numbers => :list) do -%>
jruby -S gem install mongrel activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter rails activesupport actionmailer activerecord actionpack activeresource
<% end -%>
