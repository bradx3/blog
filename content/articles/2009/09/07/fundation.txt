  I've kept my saving in a single, high interest account for a while now. It
  works particularly well as a contractor in that I can put aside tax and GST
  and earn interest on that before I have to pay it to the government.
</p>
<p>
  It has been a bit difficult to keep track of how much money was saving, and how
  much was tax/GST though, so I've written a simple app to keep track.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://fundation.lucky-dip.net">Fundation</a> lets you set up
  funds to manage your saving. Each paycheck can be automatically divided up
  into the different funds in ratios you specify.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, <a href="http://fundation.lucky-dip.net">Fundation</a> is free to use,
  so if you're having trouble remembering how much money you've got to spend, give it
  a try <a href="http://fundation.lucky-dip.net">here</a>.
