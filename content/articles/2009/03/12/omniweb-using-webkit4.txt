  I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb">Omniweb</a> web browser. I've had some problems with it being a bit slow in the past, but that seems to have been fixed with the latest <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/download/sneakypeek">Nightly Builds</a>. The latest build has brought in the same Webkit as used by Safari 4, so it's fast. Really fast.
</p>
<p> 
  Add that to all the features I like, and I'm a happy web browser. Things I miss when I'm not using Omniweb.
  <ul>
    <li>Vertical Tab Bar - I have a wide screen, and a lot of tabs open</li>
    <li>Workspaces - I can put my house hunting links in one workspace, then keep them handy, but hide them while I work</li>
    <li>Mac (?) font rendering. Something about Firefox's font just looks wrong</li>
    <li>Built in ad-blocking. It's no Adblock Plus, but I don't mind seeing ads. It's just the flashing ones I hate</li>
    <li>Location bar hides, shows when I hit Apple-L, then hides again. I don't know what I'm doing wrong on other browsers, but I can never get this to work reliably.</li>
    <li>And heaps more...</li>
  </ul>
  It's a good browser. It's good enough I paid for it, but it's free now. Nice one OmniGroup.
