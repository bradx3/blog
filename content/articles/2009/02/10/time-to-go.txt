<p>I've just released my first iPhone application.</p>

<p>Time To Go is designed to be the quickest way to tell when the train you need to catch leaves. I use it just before I leave work to know whether I need to run to the station to catch the next train.</p>

<p>There'll be a dedicated page up to log any timetable errors soon, but for now please leave any errors or suggestions in the comments for this blog post.</p>
