I had a lot of trouble finding documentation for this. If you want to make a call on the main thread in RubyCocoa, the format is something like:
</p>
<pre class="brush: ruby">
performSelectorOnMainThread_withObject_waitUntilDone('method_name:', object, true)
</pre>

<p>
So two things that took me a while:
<ol>
<li>method_name has a trailing colon. </li>
<li>The object the has the method you want to call should be the second argument. I got it in my head it should be the first for some reason.</li>
</ol>
</p>
