I was having a lot of trouble doing that. Turns out the 'instance' key exists. As far as I could find it wasn't in the doc anywhere, so this is just a post in the hope that it'll save somebody else some time in the future.

From the post:
<pre class="code">
[def]
host = abc
instance = def
port = 1433
client charset = UTF-8
tds version = 8.0
</pre>
