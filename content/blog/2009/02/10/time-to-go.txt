<p>I've just released my first iPhone application.</p>

<p>Time To Go is designed to be the quickest way to tell when the train you need to catch leaves. I use it just before I leave work to know whether I need to run to the station to catch the next train.</p>

<p>The latest version of the app (currently in review), has timetable error reporting built in.
