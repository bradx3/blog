<p>I quite like http://socwall.com. They have a rss feed for recent posts, but I wrote a small script to download a random selection instead.</p>
<p>
On OSX I could then set my desktop background to be a random picture from a folder. In my case that folder was /Users/brad/Pictures/Wallpapers/ but that could be easily changed.

The code is after the jump.
