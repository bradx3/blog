<p>I've been zsh lately. I get the feeling most shells have similar features, but somehow I stumbled across a good config file for this one. It's so good I think it is worth sharing.</p>

<p>
Features that I like in zsh:
<ul>
<li>Standard aliases, reverse search, history work as normal</i>
<li>Typos in command names and directories are fixed automatically</li>
<li>Auto 'cd' if you just type the directory name.</li>
<li>Completion of command options (so the - and -- options!)</li>
<li>Copletion of rake task names. This might the same as above, but it's still handy.</li>
<li>Completion of remote paths over scp. It's a bit slow for regular use, but can be good if you've forgotten the name of one dir.</li>
</ul>
</p>
