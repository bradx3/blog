      <h3>The $20 a month more for beer dream</h3>
<p>
  I've been hosting this blog on Slicehost for a while now. They have been a
  good host, but a full slice is more than I need these days.
</p>

<h3>The plan</h3>
<p>
  After a bit of thinking, I realised I could pretty easily move this blog
  across to Heroku. It's just a bunch of static files created by 
  <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/">Webby</a>, so I figured a tiny
  <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> app would be just the trick.
</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>
  Sinatra is perfect for these kind of tiny jobs, and ended up working without
  too much effort. I had a bit of a wrestle with Heroku initially. 
  I couldn't seem to get heroku to read my articles. They were stored in a
  directory called "output". 
</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>
  After a while, I tried tried renaming the directory to "public". That 
  seemed to do the trick. Heroku mentions that you can <i>read</i> the filesystem
  but I couldn't find too much mention of exactly <i>what</i> you can read.
  A directory called "public" seems like a pretty safe bet to be readable forever 
  though.
  I told Webby to start buiding to the public directory instead. Here's my 
  SiteFile:
  <pre>SITE.blog_dir = "articles"
SITE.output_dir = "public"</pre>
</p>
  
<h3>The app</h3>
<p>
  After getting that working, the script worked on Heroku. It's just as 
  simple as I'd hoped it would be. 
  <pre class="brush: ruby">require "rubygems"
require "sinatra"

DIR = 'public'
set :public, DIR

get '/' do
  read('index.html')
end

get '/articles/*' do
  read('articles', params["splat"], 'index.html')
end

def read(*parts)
  File.read(File.join([ DIR ] + parts))
end</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Not much to it - read index.html for the root path, or read the article 
  page for any article. It'd probably be possible to merge these into a single
  route, but it seems like that would just complicate things unecessarily.

  I've kept my saving in a single, high interest account for a while now. It
  works particularly well as a contractor in that I can put aside tax and GST
  and earn interest on that before I have to pay it to the government.
</p>
<p>
  It has been a bit difficult to keep track of how much money was saving, and how
  much was tax/GST though, so I've written a simple app to keep track.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://fundation.lucky-dip.net">Fundation</a> lets you set up
  funds to manage your saving. Each paycheck can be automatically divided up
  into the different funds in ratios you specify.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, <a href="http://fundation.lucky-dip.net">Fundation</a> is free to use,
  so if you're having trouble remembering how much money you've got to spend, give it
  a try <a href="http://fundation.lucky-dip.net">here</a>.

Being able to completely re-program your editor is fun. I feel like I've got a 
long way to go before I'm an Emacs Guru (if anybody *ever* becomes a true
Emacs Guru), but it's nice being able to easily
automate things I do in my editor.
</p>
<p>
I've been experimenting with using <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>
in development instead of script/server. It's not too bad. It's nice to have
a server always ready to go, but it does make dropping down to the debugger
difficult.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, here is a small snippet of emacs lisp to easily restart the Passenger
server for the project you are currently working on. It assumes you have 
<a href="http://rinari.rubyforge.org/">Rinari</a> installed.

<h4>The function:</h4>
<pre class="brush: plain">
(defun restart-passenger ()
  "Restart passenger using the current rinari root" (interactive)
  (shell-command (concat "touch " (rinari-root) "tmp/restart.txt")))
</pre>
<h4>And to bind it to a key</h4>
<pre class="brush: plain">
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c ' p") 'restart-passenger)
</pre>

  This is my simple backup script. It keeps everything I don't already have backed up 
  in version control safe and sound from hardware failure. Not from me though - 
  if I delete a file accidentally, that file is really gone
  (unless you act fast before the next backup runs!). 
  If I make a bad edit, that file is busted.
  <br />
  <br />
  But I can live with that. 
</p>

<p>
  <h3>backup.rb</h3>
  Backup.rb uses rsync over ssh to backup a number of different server. Rsync is good
  because it only sends what changed, so we're not transferring gigs every night.
  <br /><br />
  You'll have to make some changes to the SSH_USER, REMOTE_DIR and HOSTS constants. 
  You could also add any file types you want to ignore to the EXCLUDES list.

  <pre class="brush: ruby">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

NAME = %x{ hostname }.strip
SSH_USER = "brad"
REMOTE_DIR = "/home/brad/Backups/#{ NAME }"

HOSTS = [ "clamps", "hubert.lucky-dip.net" ]
DIRS = [
        "~/Library", 
        "~/Documents",
        "~/Pictures"
]
EXCLUDES = [
            "*Cache*",
            "*NewsFire*",
            "*Cookies*",
            "*.log",
            "HistoryIndex.ox*",
            "*Virtual Machines*",
            "*.resume",
            "*.ipsw",
            "*.dmg",
            "*.corrupt"
]

HOSTS.each do |host|
  DIRS.each do |dir|
    puts "--------------------------------------------"
    excludes = EXCLUDES.map { |e| "--exclude \"#{ e }\"" }.join(' ')
    cmd = "rsync -av --delete --delete-excluded "
    cmd += " --rsh=\"ssh -l #{ SSH_USER }\" "
    cmd += " #{ dir } #{ host }:#{ REMOTE_DIR } #{ excludes }"
    puts cmd
    system(cmd)
  end
end
  </pre>

Here's some elisp that I've written and put in my .emacs file that just kills all buffers that link to files

  I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb">Omniweb</a> web browser. I've had some problems with it being a bit slow in the past, but that seems to have been fixed with the latest <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/download/sneakypeek">Nightly Builds</a>. The latest build has brought in the same Webkit as used by Safari 4, so it's fast. Really fast.
</p>
<p> 
  Add that to all the features I like, and I'm a happy web browser. Things I miss when I'm not using Omniweb.
  <ul>
    <li>Vertical Tab Bar - I have a wide screen, and a lot of tabs open</li>
    <li>Workspaces - I can put my house hunting links in one workspace, then keep them handy, but hide them while I work</li>
    <li>Mac (?) font rendering. Something about Firefox's font just looks wrong</li>
    <li>Built in ad-blocking. It's no Adblock Plus, but I don't mind seeing ads. It's just the flashing ones I hate</li>
    <li>Location bar hides, shows when I hit Apple-L, then hides again. I don't know what I'm doing wrong on other browsers, but I can never get this to work reliably.</li>
    <li>And heaps more...</li>
  </ul>
  It's a good browser. It's good enough I paid for it, but it's free now. Nice one OmniGroup.

I had a lot of trouble finding documentation for this. If you want to make a call on the main thread in RubyCocoa, the format is something like:
</p>
<pre class="brush: ruby">
performSelectorOnMainThread_withObject_waitUntilDone('method_name:', object, true)
</pre>

<p>
So two things that took me a while:
<ol>
<li>method_name has a trailing colon. </li>
<li>The object the has the method you want to call should be the second argument. I got it in my head it should be the first for some reason.</li>
</ol>
</p>

I needed to export some data from a huge data table. Iterating through MyModel.find took too long and too much ram, so I went straight to the db instead. 
</p>

Example code was tough to find, so here's an example:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
sql = "select * from #{ MyModel.table_name }"
MyModel.connection.execute(sql) do |handle|
  handle.fetch do |row|
    # row is an array of values
    ... export row ...
  end
end
</pre>

I was having a lot of trouble doing that. Turns out the 'instance' key exists. As far as I could find it wasn't in the doc anywhere, so this is just a post in the hope that it'll save somebody else some time in the future.

<a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">ZenTest</a> is a great tool. I use it and its redgreen plugin a lot to easily keep an eye on my tests.
</p>

<p>
I use a green terminal background though, so when my tests pass, rather than a green line, I have to rely on a lack of a red line. This isn't so bad, but I thought it could be improved with a little effort.
</p>

<p>
Redish greenish is an extension of redgreen that allows you to specify the colours used for tests passing and/or failing.
</p>

<p>
To use it, <a href="http://blog.lucky-dip.net/files/redishgreenish.rb">save this file</a> into your autotest lib directory. (Mine is GEM_PATH/1.8/gems/ZenTest-3.6.1/lib/autotest/). To enable redishgreenish, you'll need to modify your autotest config file. Open "~/.autotest" and change the line:
<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby">
require 'autotest/redgreen'
</pre>
<br />
to 
<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby">
require 'autotest/redishgreenish'
</pre>
</p>

<p>
At this point, autotest will behave exactly the same as if redgreen was used. To change the colour of the lines used to signify tests passing and failing, your autotest config file should look like
<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby">
PASSED = :blue
FAILED = :yellow
require 'autotest/redishgreenish'
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Valid values for colours are
<br />
<pre class="brush: ruby">
:black, :red, :green, :yellow, :blue, :magenta, :cyan, :white
</pre>

<p>Last release didn't go so well. For some reason I figured other people had tried to install Aptana, had it fail and then given up on it like me. Turns out I was alone haha.</p>

<p>
So I spent a bit of time figuring out what changed in RDT and fixed things up. I've tested this with a straight out of the box install of Aptana m8, so hopefully it'll work for others too.</p>

<p>
If anybody does try it, please let me know if it works or not. I'm going to use this blog post as a bit of a test before I post to the Haml mail list. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies!</p>

<p>
(Oh yeah, the update site is still http://haml.lucky-dip.net/).

      <p><strong>These editors have been merged into the <a href="http://aptana.com/">Aptana</a> project. Please don't post any error reports here.</strong></p> 
<p>
I did some very basic editors for Haml and Sass a while back. At the time I was interested in Haml. It's elegant to write, and the automatically formatted html it outputs just made it a match made in heaven.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward a few months and now I'm actually using Haml and Sass. It's as good as I ever hoped it would be. With Haml and a little bit of FormBuilder magic I'm making useful forms in four short lines. Too good.
</p>
<p>
Anyway coming with using it is the chance to see some shortcomings in my own editors, so I've spent a bit of time updating them. I've set up a proper Eclipse update site, so you can just add 'http://haml.lucky-dip.net' via the 'Help - Software Updates - Find and Install' menu option. That should help minimize a few errors with the various versions of Eclipse and RDT around. All references to the RadRails plugins have been removed. There was a bit of code that I pulled into my plugin, but with RadRails/Aptana in heavy dev it's easier for me to forget about trying to keep up for a while.
</p>
<p>
Also added is code folding. There's a bit of work still to do on this one. You can currently only fold top level elements. This can be a pain when you've got all your code in one file, but if you're using layouts and partial in a sensible way it should hopefully be of some use. 
</p>
<p>
One thing I found a bit tricky was figuring out which element I was under when I was editing. Some people might like turning on space markers (can you actually do that in Eclipse?), but I figured a character matcher would do the trick. So now as you move around in the editors there'll be a blue box around the element you are currently in. At the moment it just highlights the first letter of the element. I'm going to see if I can get the whole element happening for the next release.
</p>
<p>
So I hope it works well for people. Set up an Eclipse update site of 'http://haml.lucky-dip.net' and that should keep you informed as new versions come out.
